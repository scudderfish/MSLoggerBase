1. Moving an indicator outside of the screen to the right should create a new dashboard page. (I have no idea how to do this)

2. Changing an indicator display type works but the first time you touch that indicator, it get re-sized for some reason.

5. Dashboard should probably be saved every modification instead of only when user tap disable edit gauge as I've already forgot about fifteen times already :) (with your idea of creating a backup before)

6. Still need to come up with a way of generating a default dashboard!

7. Re-implements (or remove ?) "reset gauges" feature (I at least renamed it to "reset indicators" for now to be consistent).
